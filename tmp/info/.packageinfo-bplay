Description:        The bplay package provides a simple command-line
       utility for playing and recording audio files in
       raw sample, VOC and WAV formats. To use this
       program you need a soundcard of some kind and the
       appropriate driver configured into your kernel.
       When run the program creates two processes which
       share a memory buffer. It does reading/writing on
       the disk and the sound device simultaneously, in
       order to be less liable to `pause' because the
       disk is too slow or too busy.
